# Fine-tuning Stable Diffusion and Prompt-to-Prompt Editing Techniques

In this project, I use a fine-tuning technique that lets me train text-to-image diffusion models on a concept like a character or style, called (Dreambooth)[https://dreambooth.github.io/]. Dreambooth allows the model to generate contextualized images of the subject in different scenes, poses, and views. Dreambooth is a method to personalize text-to-image models given just a few (4-6) images of a subject. However Stable Diffusion community has found that using 10 to 12 images leads to better results.
